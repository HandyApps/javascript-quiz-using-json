You’re happy to walk around in the buff, go to the toilet with the door open, and you wouldn’t think twice about eating a slice of toast that you dropped on the floor. We congratulate you in your achievement, but advise you keep the curtains closed for your neighbour’s sake!",

You are so close to being completely comfortable in your surroundings but there is still as little way to go. To help bridge the gap, take a look at our simple guide to making your house a home.",

You’re likely to have a place reserved on the sofa, but there isn’t a chance you know which draw the Sellotape is in, or what your neighbour’s name is. There is still a lot of work to be done before you’re truly settled. To help you along the way, take a look at our guide to making your house a home.",
